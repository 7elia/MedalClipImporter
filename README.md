# MedalClipImporter

I don't know if it will work on anyone else's PC but this worked for me.

I forgot to back up `clips.json` when I got a new SSD, and I couldn't be bothered to get that one file, especially because I _did_ back up all the clips I had at the time.

I couldn't live without my old clips so I decided to make this script. It requires no user input.

## Usage

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [add it to PATH](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/94933-how-do-i-edit-my-system-path-in-windows).
3. Close Medal. (Like, fully close it)
4. Run the script.
5. Open Medal and see if it has worked. If it hasn't worked, you can go to `%AppData%/Medal/store`, delete `clips.json`, and rename `clips (BACKUP).json` back to `clips.json`.
